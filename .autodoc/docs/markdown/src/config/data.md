The `sugar` code defines the configuration and data structures for a project that deals with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and programmable non-fungible tokens (pNFTs). The main structure, `ConfigData`, contains various fields related to the token standard, asset properties, creator information, and storage configurations for different platforms like AWS, NFT.Storage, Shadow Drive, Pinata, Cascade and Sense.

The `SugarConfig` struct holds the keypair and RPC URL for the Solana network, while `SolanaConfig` contains the JSON RPC URL, keypair path, and commitment level. The `AwsConfig` and `PinataConfig` structs store the respective platform-specific configurations. `cascade_api_key`, `sense_api_key` store api key to access Pastel's Cascade and Sense Protocol.

The `Creator` struct represents a creator with an address and share percentage. The `Cluster` enum represents different Solana network clusters (Devnet, Mainnet, Localnet, and Unknown). The `TokenStandard` enum distinguishes between NFT and pNFT standards.

Several utility functions are provided for serialization, deserialization, and conversion between data types. For example, `to_string` and `to_option_string` are used for serializing values into strings, while `to_pubkey` and `to_option_pubkey` are used for deserializing strings into `Pubkey` values. The `parse_string_as_date` function converts a date string into an RFC3339 formatted string, and `go_live_date_as_timestamp` converts an optional date string into a Unix timestamp. The `price_as_lamports` function converts a price in SOL to lamports.

These structures and utility functions can be used throughout the project to manage NFT and pNFT configurations, interact with various storage platforms, and handle Solana network operations.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `SugarConfig` struct and how is it used?**

   The `SugarConfig` struct is used to store the keypair and RPC URL for the project. It contains two fields: `keypair` of type `Keypair` and `rpc_url` of type `String`. This struct is likely used to configure the project with the necessary credentials and connection information.

2. **What are the different `UploadMethod` options available and how do they affect the behavior of the code?**

   The `UploadMethod` enum has six variants: `Bundlr`, `AWS`, `NftStorage`, `SHDW`, `Pinata`, `Cascade` and `Sense`. These options represent different storage services or methods for uploading assets. The choice of `UploadMethod` will determine which storage service or method is used when uploading assets in the project.

3. **How does the `TokenStandard` enum work and what are its possible values?**

   The `TokenStandard` enum represents the token standard used in the project. It has two variants: `NonFungible` and `ProgrammableNonFungible`. These options correspond to different types of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that can be used in the project. The choice of `TokenStandard` will affect the behavior of the NFTs created and managed by the project.
